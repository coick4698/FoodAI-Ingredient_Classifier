# 🍱 Food Ingredient Classification AI

A 4-week ISS research project using CNN-based image classification to identify ingredients in food photos and detect allergy-related components.

## 🔍 Motivation
In a world where food allergies are a growing concern, this project aims to use AI to analyze food images and automatically detect potential allergens. Also, to recommend food items that contain a user's preferred ingredients based on multi-label classification results.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Classify visible ingredients in food images (multi-label classification)
- Detect if any common allergens are present
- Build a clean model pipeline using CNN and Food-101 dataset
- Visualize model attention

## 🗓️ Timeline (4 weeks)
| Week | Tasks |
|------|-------|
| 1 | Topic confirmation, dataset selection (Food-101), related papers review |
| 2 | Model setup (CNN / Transfer Learning), data preprocessing |
| 3 | Training, evaluation, visualization |
| 4 | Paper writing (Overleaf), GitHub final polish |
